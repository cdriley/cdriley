I've got two semesters of COBOL programming from 1974 &1975.  Trained as aircraft electrician in Army and spent a 
year with 12 AH-1G Cobras. Spent about 5 years working with DitMco Wire Harness Analyzer at Boeing/Wichita.  
Learned Fortran while working on a project with and embedded Ingress DB on a VAX 11/780 computer.  Later, worked
on projects with C controlling overhead 20-ton cranes.  Got into an IIOT project, before the acronymn was popular, 
using Inductive Automation's Ignition product to interface to Allen-Bradley PLCs.  Ignition used and ODBC interface
to communicate with the PLCs.  Data collected from the processing systems helped Boeing to verify NADCAP process 
compliance.
I've got Mariadb installed on one Raspberry PI, Mosquitto/MQTT on another and have a couple of Raspberry Pi 3B+ and 
RPi Zeros publishing temperature and humidity data to be captured by another RPi to transform the data to be loaded 
into my database.
Now that I'm retired, this serves as my hobby.
